An interface to common UNIX grpahics interfaces for Python using the ctypes
module. It supports the entire Xlib interface for the X Window System, adding
features that makes X11 more "Pythonic", as well as supporting OpenGL by
scanning XML descriptions of the API and loading the symbols form the GL
library dynamically.

This is an old project, developed around 2009, and does not see many updates
since X is being phased out of many of the major Linux distributions. Further,
there seems to be a bug with newer Python interpreters that results in a
segmentation fault in some of the test programs.
